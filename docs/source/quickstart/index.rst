===========
Quick Start
===========

**The goal of this portion of the guide is to be a very deliberate step-by-step
explanation of not only how to use OpenCafe components, but to also explain
what types of problems are solved by using OpenCafe.**

To get started, let's install and initialize OpenCafe. We can do this by
running the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install opencafe
    cafe-config init

As an example, lets write a few tests for the GitHub API. Let's assume that we
don't have language bindings or SDKs for our API. We can create a simple
client using the BaseHTTPClient class provided by the OpenCafe HTTP plugin, which
is a lightweight wrapper for the `requests` package. First, we'll need to
install the http plugin:

.. code-block:: bash

    cafe-config plugin install http

Now we can create a simple script to request a list of the repositories in
the CafeHub project:

.. code-block:: python
    
    import json

    from cafe.engine.http.client import BaseHTTPClient


    client = BaseHTTPClient()
    response = client.get('https://api.github.com/orgs/cafehub/repos')
    print response.status_code
    print json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2)

This will generate some warnings that we will address later, but the outcome
should be similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    ]

The BaseHTTPClient simply passes the response back as `requests` would, so we
can treat the response similarly to view its content. At this point, it
doesn't look like the http plugin is adding any more value than `requests`
would. Let's see what we can do about that. First, let's enable logging and
see what happens.

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    import logging
    import os
    import sys

    from cafe.engine.http.client import BaseHTTPClient
    from cafe.common.reporting import cclogging

    os.environ['CAFE_ENGINE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH']='.'
    cclogging.init_root_log_handler()
    root_log = logging.getLogger()
    root_log.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stderr))
    root_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    client = BaseHTTPClient()
    response = client.get('https://api.github.com/orgs/cafehub/repos')

With logging enabled, lets execute our script again to see the difference.

.. code-block:: bash

That's a little better. We get a verbose log entry for the request made and the
response we received.  The output from the http client is meant to be human
readable and to create an audit trail of what occurred while a test or script
is executed.

Now let's add a few more requests to our script:

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    import logging
    import os
    import sys

    from cafe.engine.http.client import BaseHTTPClient
    from cafe.common.reporting import cclogging

    os.environ['CAFE_ENGINE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH']='.'
    cclogging.init_root_log_handler()
    root_log = logging.getLogger()
    root_log.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stderr))
    root_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    client = BaseHTTPClient()
    response = client.get('https://api.github.com/repos/cafehub/opencafe/commits?per_page=1')
    response = client.get('https://api.github.com/repos/cafehub/opencafe/issues?per_page=1')
    response = client.get('https://api.github.com/repos/cafehub/opencafe/forks?per_page=1')

As we make more requests, a few concerns come to mind. Right now we are
hard-coding the base url (https://api.github.com) in each request. At the very
least, we should factor what is likely to change out of our requests:

.. code:: python

    import json
    import logging
    import os
    import sys

    from cafe.engine.http.client import BaseHTTPClient
    from cafe.common.reporting import cclogging

    os.environ['CAFE_ENGINE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH']='.'
    cclogging.init_root_log_handler()
    root_log = logging.getLogger()
    root_log.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stderr))
    root_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    client = BaseHTTPClient()

    base_url = 'https://api.github.com'
    organization = 'cafehub'
    project = 'opencafe'

    response = client.get(
        '{base_url}/repos/{org}/{project}/commits?per_page=1'.format(
            base_url=base_url, org=organization, project=project))

    response = client.get(
        '{base_url}/repos/{org}/{project}/issues?per_page=1'.format(
            base_url=base_url, org=organization, project=project))

    response = client.get(
        '{base_url}/repos/{org}/{project}/forks?per_page=1'.format(
            base_url=base_url, org=organization, project=project))

The GitHub API is expansive, so we could go on for some time defining more
requests. Rather than defining these in-line, defining these functions in a
common class or module would make more sense.

.. code:: python

    import json
    import logging
    import os
    import sys

    from cafe.engine.clients.base import BaseClient
    from cafe.engine.http.client import BaseHTTPClient
    from cafe.common.reporting import cclogging

    class GitHubClient(BaseClient):

        def __init__(self, base_url):
            self.base_url = base_url
            self.client = BaseHTTPClient()
        
        def get_project_commits(self, org_name, project_name):
            return self.client.get(
                '{base_url}/repos/{org}/{project}/commits?per_page=1'.format(
                    base_url=self.base_url, org=organization, project=project))
        
        def get_project_issues(self, org_name, project_name):
            return self.client.get(
                '{base_url}/repos/{org}/{project}/commits?per_page=1'.format(
                    base_url=self.base_url, org=organization, project=project))
        
        def get_project_forks(self, org_name, project_name):
            return self.client.get(
                '{base_url}/repos/{org}/{project}/commits?per_page=1'.format(
                    base_url=self.base_url, org=organization, project=project))
    
    os.environ['CAFE_ENGINE_CONFIG_FILE_PATH']='.'
    cclogging.init_root_log_handler()
    root_log = logging.getLogger()
    root_log.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stderr))
    root_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    base_url = 'https://api.github.com'
    organization = 'cafehub'
    project = 'opencafe'
    client = GitHubClient(base_url)
    
    resp1 = client.get_project_commits(org_name=organization, project_name=project)
    resp2 = client.get_project_issues(org_name=organization, project_name=project)
    resp3 = client.get_project_forks(org_name=organization, project_name=project) 

Now that our HTTP requests are in better shape, let's talk about dealing with
the responses. The response object has a `json` method that will transform the
body of the response into a Python dictionary. While treating the response content as a dictionary is good enough for
quick scripts and possibly for very stable APIs, it scales poorly
when dealing with large APIs or APIs that are in development.

Accessing the response as a dictionary isn't too difficult when a response body
has one or two properties, but let's jump back to the first response output we
looked at. It has dozens of properties, including ones that are nested. Using
the response as-is requires memorizing the response structure or constantly
referencing API documentation as you code. If you make a mistake, you may not find
that out until you run the script. Also, if/when the name of one of the properties
or the structure of the API response changes, this means tediously changing the property each place it is used or
trying to do a string replace across the project, which can have unintended.
consequences unless you're very careful.

Writing Request and Response Models
===================================

An alternate approach is to deserialize the JSON response to an object. This
is the approach that most SDKs and language bindings use. This
greatly simplifies refactoring of response properties and has the added bonus
of error detection by linters if you use an invalid property name. If you're
using a code editor which offers autocomplete functionality, you can also
use that when developing new tests, which removes most of the need to
reference API documentation after you've done the groundwork developing the
response models. Here's an example of what the response model for our first
request would look like:

.. code:: python

    class Issue(AutoMarshallingModel):

        def __init__(self, url, repository_url, labels_url, comments_url, events_url,
                    html_url, id, number, title, user, labels, state, locked,
                    assignee, assignees, milestone, comments, created_at,
                    updated_at, closed_at, body, closed_by):
            
            self.url = url
            self.repository_url = repository_url
            self.labels_url = labels_url
            self.comments_url = comments_url

    class User(AutoMarshallingModel):

        def __init__(self, login, id, avatar_url, gravatar_id, url, html_url,
                    followers_url, following_url, gists_url, starred_url,

            self.login = login

        def _json_to_obj(cls, serialized_str):
            resp_dict = json.loads(serialized_str)
            return User(**resp_dict)


    class Label(AutoMarshallingModel):

        def __init__(self, id, url, name, color, default):
            
            self.id = id
            self.url = url
            self.name = name
            self.color = color
            self.default = default
        
        @classmethod
        def _json_to_obj(cls, serialized_str):
            resp_dict = json.loads(serialized_str)
            return Label(**resp_dict)

Any class that inherits from the AutoMarshallingModel class is expected
to implement the _json_to_obj method, _obj_to_json method, or both. This
depends on whether the model is being used to handle requests, responses,
or both.

This example requires quite a bit of boilerplate code. However, because
these objects are explicitly defined, static analysis tools will be able to
assist us going forward. We also wanted to use this simple, explict way for
this demo so it would be easier to understand. In more practical
implementations, you may want to take advantage of Python's dynamic nature to
simplify the setting of properties.


Writing an Auto-Serializing Client
==================================

Now that we have response models, we can refactor our client to use them.

.. code:: python

    from cafe.engine.http.client import AutoMarshallingHTTPClient


    class GitHubClient(AutoMarshallingHTTPClient):

        def __init__(self, base_url):
            super(GitHubClient, self).__init__(
                serialize_format='json', deserialize_format='json')
            self.base_url = base_url
            
        def get_project_issue(self, org_name, project_name, issue_id):
                
            url = '{base_url}/repos/{org}/{project}/issues/{issue_id}'.format(
                base_url=self.base_url, org=organization, project=project,
                issue_id=issue_id)
            return self.get(url, response_entity_type=Issue)

There's a few changes to note. The AutoMarshallingHTTPClient class
subclasses the BaseHTTPClient, so there's no longer a need to create a client.
We can also specify what type of content we want this client to serialize to
and from. The response_entity_type parameter defines what type to expect the
response to be. This together with serialization formats set when the client
was instantiated determine which serialization methods are called on the
response contents.

Managing Test Data
==================

Before we start writing our tests, lets step back and deal with one more
issue. In the original script, we had statically defined certain data
such as the GitHub URL, the organization name, and the project name. There
are many reasons why you should not hardcode these types of values. Of those,
the most important is that we should not have to make code changes whenever we
want to use different test data. We should be able to provide the test data we
want to use at runtime, which makes our tests more portable and dynamic. 

There are many sources we could use for our test data, but for this example we
will use a plain text file with headers that can be parsed by Python's
``SafeConfigParser``. For this to work, we will need to create a class that
represents the data that we want to store in the file.

.. code:: python

    from cafe.engine.models.data_interfaces import ConfigSectionInterface


    class GitHubConfig(ConfigSectionInterface):

        SECTION_NAME = 'GitHub'

        @property
        def base_url(self):
            return self.get('base_url')

        @property
        def organization(self):
            return self.get('organization')

        @property
        def project(self):
            return self.get('project')

        @property
        def issue_id(self):
            return self.get('issue_id')

Note that there is nothing in this class that explicitly states the
type of the data source. This is because the OpenCafe ``data_interfaces``
package provides a uniform interfaces including environment variables and
JSON data. For the purpose of this guide, we will just use plain text files.
Our class says we should have one section titled ``GitHub`` with four
properties. The actual configuration file would look like the following
example:

.. code:: python

    [GitHub]
    base_url = https://api.github.com
    organization = cafehub
    project = opencafe
    issue_id = 40

Writing and Running a Test
==========================

**From this point in the demo, you can use the** `opencafe-demo`_
**project to follow along with the guide if you want to execute the steps
yourself.**

.. _opencafe-demo: https://github.com/dwalleck/opencafe-demo

Now that we have our test client in order, we can write several tests to see
how OpenCafe handles configuration and logging.

.. code:: python

    from cafe.drivers.unittest.fixtures import BaseTestFixture

    from opencafe_demo.github.github_client import GitHubClient
    from opencafe_demo.github.github_config import GitHubConfig


    class BasicGitHubTest(BaseTestFixture):

        @classmethod
        def setUpClass(cls):
            super(BasicGitHubTest, cls).setUpClass()  # Sets up logging/reporting
            cls.config_data = GitHubConfig()

            cls.organization = cls.config_data.organization
            cls.project = cls.config_data.project
            cls.issue_id = cls.config_data.issue_id
            cls.client = GitHubClient(cls.config_data.base_url)

        def test_get_issue_response_code_is_200(self):
            response = self.client.get_project_issue(
                self.organization, self.project, self.issue_id)
            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)

        def test_id_is_not_null_for_get_issue_request(self):
            response = self.client.get_project_issue(
                self.organization, self.project, self.issue_id)
            # The response signature is the raw response from Requests except
            # for the `entity` property, which is the object that represents
            # the response content
            issue = response.entity
            self.assertIsNotNone(issue.id)

In this test class, we inherit from OpenCafe's ``BaseTestFixture`` class. This
base class automatically handles all of the logging setup that we were
previously doing by hand. It inherits from Python's ``unittest.TestCase``,
so for all other intents and purposes it behaves the same as any other
unittest-based test.

Before we can run this test, we need to get our configuration data file in
place. When we executed the ``cafe-config init`` command at the start of the
guide, you may have noticed in the output that some directories were created.
You should now have a ``.opencafe`` directory. This is where all configuration
data and test logs will be by default (these paths can be changed in the
``.opencafe/engine.config`` file. See the full documentation for further
details). We will need to create a directory named ``GitHub`` in which we
will put our configuration file which we will call ``prod.config``. The names
used are arbitrary, but they create a convention that will be used when
we begin running our tests.

For configuration data and logging, OpenCafe uses
a convention of ``<product-name> <config-file-name>``. For configuration files,
the ``<config-file-name>`` file will be loaded from the
``.opencafe/configs/<product-name>`` directory. For logging, logs for each
test run will be saved in a directory named by the date time stamp of when
the tests were run in the ``.opencafe/logs/<product-name>/<config-file-name>``
directory.

For this guide, I'll be using OpenCafe's unittest-based runner to execute the
tests. All the tests in the ``github`` project can be run by executing
``cafe-runner github prod.config``.

.. code:: bash

The preamble output from the test runner pretty prints the location of all
configuration files used for the test run, as well as the the location of the
logs generated during the test run. Here's what the contents of the log
directory look like:

.. code:: bash

    C:\Users\dwall\.opencafe\logs\github\prod.config\2017-03-29_23_20_21.391000> ls

    Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

Two log files were generated by this test run. The second log file is named by
the full package name of the test class that was run. If there had been
multiple test classes loaded for execution, there would be one file per class
run. The benefit of this is to be able to jump directly to the log file that
you are interested in inspecting. The contents of the logs contain the HTTP
requests made during test execution, but they also contain headers to mark
what point the in the lifecycle of the test is being executed:

.. code:: bash

The other file, ``cafe.master.log`` is a summation of the other log files in
the order the tests were executed. This allows the user to consume the logs
however they find easiest.
